# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  After receiving my first ever promotion at my first ever "real" job, I determined that my happiness and fulliment in life won't come from climbing any corporate ladder but rather from the positive impact I can make on other people's lives. Therefore my purpose is to create and improve products and technology that do exactly that. 
about_me: >
  I'm a curious and constant learner who grew up in the suburbs of Kansas and ventured out to New York City in search of congruence between my personal and professional goals. I have nearly 5 years of Project Management experience, 2.5 years of Product Managment experience, and have spent the last year sharpening my technical abilities.
