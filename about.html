        Hi, my name is Robert and I'm a product manager, hacker, musician, and explorer. I have over 5 years of project management experience and over 2.5 years of dedicated product management experience. The Product Management path came naturally to me because I believe empathy is one of my strongest qualities and it continues to be a key ingredient to success in that role. It allows me to see products from a wide variety of perspectives and foster a healthy team dynamic. I love to think big and take on tough problems that have a high potential to improve peopleâ€™s lives. 
      </p>

        I am always open to new adventures! <a class="about_me_links" href="/projects">projects</a> section to check out what I've built, <a class="about_me_links" href="/contact">shoot me an email</a> or connect on <a class="about_me_links" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-keenan/">linkedIn</a>.
